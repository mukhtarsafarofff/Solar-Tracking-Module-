This solar tracker is  a system that positions an object at an angle relative to the Sun.Here i have used LDR to detect the presence of light / measuring the intensity of light.In This circuit  I can  adjust the threshold (sensitivity) of digital output by tuning the on-board variable resistor (potentiometer). Simple usage as it is the digital output, so you will know is the light present and decide what to do with it.L293D  IC is a medium power motor driver perfect for driving DC Motors and this driver  greatly simplifies and increases the ease with which you may control motors, relays, etc from micro-controllers.  It can drive motors up to 12V with a total DC current of up to 600mA.

Dieser Solartracker ist ein System, das ein Objekt in einem Winkel relativ zur Sonne positioniert. Hier habe ich LDR verwendet, um das Vorhandensein von Licht zu erkennen/die Lichtintensit√§t zu messen.
