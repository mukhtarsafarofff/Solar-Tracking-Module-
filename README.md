This solar tracker is  a system that positions an object at an angle relative to the Sun.Here i have used LDR to detect the presence of light / measuring the intensity of light.In This circuit  I can  adjust the threshold (sensitivity) of digital output by tuning the on-board variable resistor (potentiometer). Simple usage as it is the digital output, so you will know is the light present and decide what to do with it.
